We started our first meet by discussing the following:

- our favorite book and why.
- the last book we read.
- the book we would like to read next.
- The expectations we have from this book reading club.
  - Prefer books we can read in their original language: English and German for
    now.
  - Read from Russian authors
  - Read from British authors


Who is comfortable to host the club's meetings?

All present members expressed interest in hosting. We concluded that we'll be
alternating hosts, confirming the next host at each meeting.


We discussed rules we wanted extablished:

- Commitment: helps keep the motivation high in the group.
- In average once a month: this is subject to change if need be.


How do we name the book club?

During the meeting, no plausible propositions were made, and the decision was
postponed to the next meeting to give the participants time to think about one.

Since a name was necessary to host those pages, until a name is chosen, the name
"The cosmopolitan bookshelf" will be used.


How do we chose the book to read?

We decided that we would chose our next book by voting.
