Discussion about the following
------------------------------

- our favorite book and why.
- the last book we read.
- the book we would like to read next.
- The expectations we have from this book reading club.

  - Prefer books we can read in their original language: English and German for
    now.
  - Read from Russian authors
  - Read from British authors


Who is comfortable to host the club's meetings?
-----------------------------------------------

All present members expressed interest in hosting. We concluded that we'll be
alternating hosts, confirming the next host at each meeting.


Rules that are important
------------------------

- Commitment: helps keep the motivation high in the group.
- In average once a month: this is subject to change if need be.


The club's name
---------------

During the meeting, no plausible propositions were made, and the decision was
postponed to the next meeting to give the participants time to think about one.

Since a name was necessary to host those pages, until a name is chosen, the name
"The cosmopolitan bookshelf" will be used.


Choosing a book
---------------

We decided that we would chose our next book by voting. The result of our first
vote is:

The Last Day of a Condemned Man
 - Author: Victor Hugo
 - Published: 1829
 - original title: Le Dernier jour d'un condamn√©
